## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Andy

Coding is more than a professionâ€”it's a passion. I specialize in **Web Development**, working predominantly with industry-leading tools like Nest.JS, Next.JS, Laravel/Lumen, and Go-lang to produce high-performance web applications that meet diverse business needs.

See more about my working experiences at [my resume](/resume) page.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="hot-beverage" />
