## Hi <Twemoji emoji="waving hand" /> I'm Andy Nur

I like coding, I do stuff related to **Web development**, I work mainly with **React/Node** and **Pure Javascript**.

#### A brief timeline of my career:

See more about my working experiences at [my resume](/resume) page.

## Why have this blog?

> Because sharing is learning

I believe noting down and sharing is the best way to learn! So I created this blog, where I keep things that I learned, find useful, and necessary to save for later.

More than just technical stuff, there are personal thoughts about work and life from the perspective of a Software Engineer.

It would be highly appreciated if I could read your comment or hear your thoughts on what I wrote <Twemoji emoji="hot-beverage" />
